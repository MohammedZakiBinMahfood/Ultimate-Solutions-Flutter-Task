# uiltimate_solutions_flutter_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Create a Flutter app based on the attached design and APIs.

In the Home Screen: after loading data from the API, save it into a local SQLite database and use SQL statements to fetch filtered data.

If the user leaves the app idle or in the background for 2 minutes, the app should automatically log out and return to the login screen.

The app must be compiled and run using the latest Flutter SDK.

Focus on delivering simple, clean, and bug-free code.

Create a GitHub repository and commit your work progressively.

Write a simple README file explaining your software design choices.

After completing the task, send the repository URL.

🙏 Personal Message
I am writing this message with a heavy heart because I truly aspired to complete the task on time, especially knowing that this opportunity is directly linked to employment, and I cannot afford to miss it.

However, sometimes circumstances are beyond our control. Despite all my efforts and the significant amount of time I invested, unexpected technical issues and personal obligations prevented me from finishing on schedule. The task size was larger than the allocated time, and it coincided with the weekend (Thursday and Friday), during which I had additional commitments. Moreover, I come from an area that suffers from frequent power outages, which affected my ability to work continuously.

Nevertheless, I did not spare any effort. I stayed up late on Thursday night, and on Friday night I worked straight through until 3 AM and continued immediately after. This task means a lot to me.

I have already started building the project using the Clean Architecture pattern. I created two main screens: the Login Screen and the Splash Page. I was close to finishing API integration and setting up Local Storage using SQLite, but technical problems slowed me down.

One major issue was a conflict between the Flutter and Gradle versions after updating the SDK, which forced me to reset the environment entirely — costing me valuable time and effort.

I am truly saddened because this opportunity means so much to me. If there is any possibility of granting a short extension, I will complete the task and deliver it in the best possible quality. If not, I still sincerely appreciate the chance and your high professional standards.
